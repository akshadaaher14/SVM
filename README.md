# Loan Approval Prediction using SVM

This project demonstrates a Machine Learning solution to predict whether a loan will be approved or not based on customer data. It uses **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** as the classifier and applies data preprocessing techniques, data scaling, and SMOTE for handling imbalanced data.


## Project Files

- `loan_approved.xls` – Dataset containing customer loan application data.
- `SVM.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook containing the entire code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.


## Features

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
- Handling missing values  
- Data Scaling using `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn  
- Train-Test Split  
- SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) for class balancing  
- Model building and evaluation using SVM  
- Saving trained model using Pickle


##  Requirements

- Python >= 3.6  
- pandas  
- scikit-learn  
- imbalanced-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook
